## üìã Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
All user inputs should be validated using the utilities in `src/lib/input-sanitization.ts`:

```typescript
import { sanitizeText, sanitizeFileName, isValidEmail } from '@/lib/input-sanitization';

// Example usage
const cleanText = sanitizeText(userInput);
const safeFileName = sanitizeFileName(fileName);
const isValid = isValidEmail(email);
```

### 2. Error Boundary Usage
Wrap components that may throw errors:

```typescript
import { ErrorBoundary } from '@/components/error-boundary';

<ErrorBoundary>
  <YourComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Always validate environment variables at app startup:

```typescript
import { validateEnv } from '@/lib/env-validation';

// In your app initialization
try {
  validateEnv();
} catch (error) {
  // Handle missing configuration
}
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting for sensitive operations:

```typescript
import { RateLimiter } from '@/lib/input-sanitization';

const limiter = new RateLimiter(10, 60000); // 10 requests per minute

if (!limiter.check(userId)) {
  throw new Error('Too many requests');
}
```

## üîí Additional Security Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use secure secret management (e.g., Vercel Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days)
   - Use different keys for development and production

2. **Firebase Security Rules**
   - Review and update Firestore security rules
   - Implement proper read/write permissions
   - Test rules thoroughly before deployment
   - Use Firebase Emulator for testing

3. **Authentication**
   - Enable Firebase Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - Implement email verification
   - Add "remember this device" functionality
   - Consider implementing session timeout

4. **Data Protection**
   - Enable encryption at rest (Firebase Storage)
   - Use HTTPS-only connections
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Regular backup procedures

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)
   - Monitor suspicious activity
   - Log authentication attempts
   - Track API usage patterns

6. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Add CSP headers to further restrict content sources
   - Implement nonce-based CSP for inline scripts
   - Report CSP violations to monitoring service

7. **CORS Configuration**
   - Restrict CORS to known domains only
   - Never use `*` in production
   - Validate origin headers

8. **File Uploads**
   - Scan uploaded files for malware
   - Limit file sizes (already implemented: 10MB)
   - Validate file types server-side
   - Store files in secure, separate storage

9. **API Security**
   - Implement API rate limiting
   - Use API keys with limited scopes
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies
   - Implement request signing for sensitive operations

10. **Regular Updates**
