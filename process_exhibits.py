# --- COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR COPILOT ---
# Goal: Build a file processing agent that uses the Google Gemini API to analyze images, 
# perform OCR, and rename files via the Google Drive API.
# Required Libraries: google-genai, google-api-python-client, google-auth-oauthlib (for service account)

# Security:
# The script MUST read the following credentials from environment variables (Replit Secrets):
# 1. GEMINI_API_KEY
# 2. DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT (the JSON key file contents)
# 3. DRIVE_FOLDER_ID (optional: as a secret for your Drive folder id)

# File Processing Logic:
# 1. Define a main function.
# 2. Inside the function, initialize the Google Drive API client using the DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT secret.
# 3. Write a function analyze_and_rename(file_bytes) that accepts the binary data of an image file.
# 4. Inside analyze_and_rename, call the Gemini model with this exact prompt for structured output:
#    "PERFORM OCR on this image. Then, extract the following three pieces of information to create a structured filename: 1. The most accurate date (DD-MM-YYYY). 2. The type of document (e.g., 'Email', 'Text_Message', 'Medical_Bill'). 3. A short, professional summary of the content (5 words max). Format the output EXACTLY like this: [DATE]_[TYPE]_[SUMMARY]"
# 5. The main function should then iterate through files retrieved from your secure DRIVE_FOLDER_ID and use the Google Drive API to apply the new filename.
