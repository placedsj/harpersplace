## 2025-05-23 - Show/Hide Password Toggle
**Learning:** Password visibility toggles are critical for mobile users and those with cognitive impairments. Masking characters by default increases typing errors, leading to frustration and abandonment. A toggle reduces cognitive load by allowing verification before submission.
**Action:** Always include a show/hide toggle on password inputs, especially on mobile-first designs. Use clear iconography (Eye/EyeOff) and accessible labels.
