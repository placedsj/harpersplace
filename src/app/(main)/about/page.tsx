          <p>
            This organization was founded on the belief that a child&apos;s right
            to safety and stability must be non-negotiable. Our namesake,
            Harper, represents every child caught in the unpredictable chaos of
            family breakdown. We exist to provide the resources and backbone
            necessary for every parent to successfully build a secure and
            thriving &quot;place&quot; for their child, just as we have done.
