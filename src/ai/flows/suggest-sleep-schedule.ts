Analyze the following information:
- Child's Age: {{{ageInMonths}}} months
- Recent Logs: {{{recentLogs}}}
- Desired Schedule Goals: {{#if desiredSchedule}}{{{desiredSchedule}}}{{else}}None specified.{{/if}}

Based on this information, provide the following:

2.  **Next Feed Time:** Predict the next feeding time based on typical patterns for this age.
3.  **Suggested Schedule:** Create a simple, ideal schedule for the rest of the day, including nap windows and a final bedtime.
4.  **Sleep Tips:** Offer 2-3 practical tips for improving sleep habits (e.g., quiet down routines, creating a good sleep environment).
5.  **Reasoning:** Briefly explain your recommendations based on common sleep patterns for a child of this age and the provided logs.`,
