Analyze the following message draft from one co-parent to another.

Original Message:
"{{{message}}}"

Your task is to:
1.  Rewrite the message to be more positive, collaborative, and less accusatory. Frame requests clearly and politely. Keep the focus on the child's well-being.
2.  Provide a list of the key changes you made and briefly explain the reasoning for each. For example, "Replaced 'you always' with 'I've noticed that' to avoid blame," or "Added a specific suggestion for a solution to be more collaborative."

The tone should be helpful and constructive, not critical. You are a coach helping the parent communicate more effectively for the sake of their child.`,
